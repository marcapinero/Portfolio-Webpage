         <!-- I created two classes to hold the text for my about me section.-->
        <p class ="About-Me-Text1">I am mechanically minded, and I love to think of creative ways to build something from the ground up. Over the years I have learned to be a team player, and collaborate with others on projects. I am excited about my journey to becoming a software developer. With clear communication, thinking outside of the box, and being a team player. I believe I will be a great addition to any software development team.</p>
        
        <p class ="About-Me-Text2">Outside of coding, you can catch me being out in nature, and staying active. In my spare time, I love playing racquetball, skateboarding, playing the guitar, and reading about deep philosophical problems.</p>
